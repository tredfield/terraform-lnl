## Why Choose Terraform?

{==

What about CloudFormation, CDK, Pulumi?

==}

- CloudFormation and AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) are viable tools if you are only working with AWS
- Terraform has the advantage of being cloud agnostic and allows you to provision across multiple cloud providers
- Terraform also works for more than just provisioning infrastructure:
    - Manage Kubernetes
    - Salesforce
    - On-prem resources
    - Databases
    - Security and Authentication
    - Policy as Code
    - Much more!
- Terraform now has CDK! This allows you to write terraform in TypeScript, Python, Java, C#, and Go
- What about Pulumi? Pulumi is a great choice as well. Similar to CDK Pulumi allows you to write infrastructure in many programming languages
