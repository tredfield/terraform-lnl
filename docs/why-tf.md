Writing terraform code your first time is probably going to seem like a PITA, why not just use the console?

==}

- Terraform is repeatable! Your client will think you are a superhero when they ask if you can create yet another new environment and you say “yes, just give me a few minutes”
- Terraform gives you a chance to review the changes that will be made before they are applied. And changes are easy to rollback
- In a disaster you can easily recover an environment in very little time
- Terraform prevents infrastructure drift
- Being it is code, you check it into git and have the same accountability, history, etc
